Domotica (Home automation)


I begin testing mqtt for home automation, here you can find some initial simple test files
i got used to linux/c again and a main application


Will use:

mosquitto (MQTT broker/server running in a linux server)

paho.mqtt.c (Async c libray)

OrangePI (Raspberry PI clone, programming in C)

ESP8266 (probably pragrammed with arduino)
